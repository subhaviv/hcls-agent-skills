A curated collection of agent skills for healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) workflows, following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io). **These 39 domain skills make any AI agent measurably better at HCLS questions.** In a [410-prompt pairwise evaluation](./eval/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md) (380 single-skill + 30 cross-skill) judged by Claude Opus 4.7, skills win **70–86%** of head-to-head comparisons depending on harness, with **up to 85% critical thinking** and **up to 87% scientific accuracy** win rates. Skills work on 20+ platforms including Kiro, Amazon Quick, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, AWS Strands SDK, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, CrewAI, LangChain, and more.

Skills fall into two categories: **reasoning skills** encode methodology, decision frameworks, and domain expertise to guide the agent's thinking (e.g., ACMG variant classification, target trial emulation, HEDIS measure specification); **pipeline skills** encode tool-specific commands, code patterns, and parameter tables that produce runnable artifacts (e.g., GATK4 variant calling, RDKit cheminformatics, HL7v2 parsing). Together they make any AI agent a competent collaborator across [genomics](#genomics), [single-cell analysis](#single-cell-analysis), [medical imaging](#medical-imaging), [protein structure](#protein-structure), [translational research](#cross-domain), [pharmacoepidemiology](#pharmacoepidemiology--real-world-data), [clinical data](#clinical-data), [drug discovery](#drug-discovery), [proteomics](#proteomics), [clinical data review](#clinical-data-review), [multi-omics integration](#multi-omics-integration), [healthcare operations](#healthcare-operations), [machine learning](#cross-domain), and [AWS architecture](#cross-domain).

## Why Agent Skills for Healthcare & Life Sciences? 

The line between scientist and builder is fading. Molecular biologists want to classify variants from sequencing data, run single-cell analysis pipelines, and design validation studies all without waiting for IT to scope a project. AI agents like Amazon Quick and Kiro make this possible: universal tools that let a researcher go from question to working system in minutes.

Capability is no longer the bottleneck; methodology is. Every generation of LLMs grows more powerful and knowledgeable. They know facts but not *procedures*; the multi-step decision chains that domain experts internalize over years. They have "read every textbook" but never worked through the nuance of biology or patient care. When an epidemiologist asks an AI agent to emulate a target trial from claims data, adjust for time-varying confounding, or validate a risk stratification model, reproducible output must be both methodologically and scientifically sound and not just plausible. In regulated domains like healthcare and life sciences, the gap between plausible and correct has patient safety and compliance consequences.

Agent skills close this gap. A skill encodes the structured reasoning that experts follow, such as exact criteria, specific thresholds, failure modes that only experience teaches. Think of it as the computational equivalent of a lab protocol: instead of sitting in a binder, it actively guides the agent in real time. Three properties make this better than the alternatives:

1. **Better than long prompts.** Real research tasks require multi-step reasoning. Benchmarks like [LifeSciBench](https://openai.com/index/introducing-life-sci-bench/) show 79% of realistic life science tasks involve multiple decision steps. A monolithic system prompt is brittle, unversioned, and impossible to share across a team. A skill gives the agent a structured starting point: pre-encoded decision logic that's reproducible across users, sessions, and platforms.

2. **Portable and updateable.** These skills follow the open [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) and work across 20+ platforms (Kiro, Quick, Strands Agent SDK, AgentCore, Claude Code, Codex). When Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes new HCC coefficients or ACMG updates classification criteria, you edit the skill to reflect that knowledge for all future work.

3. **Encodes what textbooks don't.** Skills capture tacit and institutional knowledge: which bioinformatics parameters work for your sequencer, which reagent vendor to trust, which clinical codes your payer actually accepts. The kind of judgment that lives in a senior scientist's head and takes years to transfer.

The biggest gains appear exactly where unguided agents fail most: on the hard, multi-step regulatory and methodological questions where getting it wrong has consequences. Outputs become reproducible, not just occasionally correct.

This is what raises the floor for every scientist without lowering the ceiling. Skills don't skip the learning; they provide scaffolding so a new postdoc's analysis meets the same methodological standard as the PI's while they build understanding of *why* each step matters. The work shifts from instructing the agent ("here's how to avoid immortal time bias") to exercising judgment at a higher level ("is a new-user active-comparator design even the right approach?").

```

### Platform Compatibility

These skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) (`SKILL.md` + YAML frontmatter) and work across multiple AI assistants:

| Platform | Install Command | How It Works |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Kiro IDE** | `./install.sh --target kiro` | Copies skills to `~/.kiro/skills/` and agent config to `~/.kiro/agents/` |
| **Kiro CLI** | `./install.sh --target kiro` | Same as above; switch with `/agent hcls` |
| **Claude Code** | `./install.sh --target claude-code` | Symlinks skills into `.claude/skills/` for auto-discovery |
| **Quick Desktop** | `./install.sh --target quick-desktop` | Prints upload instructions (GUI-only: Settings → Skills → Upload) |
| **GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, 50+ others** | `npx skills add .` | Universal CLI from [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) |
| **CrewAI** | `skills=["./skills"]` | Native parameter on Agent class |
| **LangChain / LangGraph** | Documented pattern | Skills as prompt-driven specializations |
| **AWS Strands SDK** | `AgentSkills + plugins=[skills]` | Built-in plugin, deploys to AgentCore |
| **Claude Messages API** | Upload via Skills Management API | First-class `container` parameter with CRUD |

### Kiro (IDE & CLI)

```bash
./install.sh --target kiro

# In Kiro CLI, switch to the unified agent:
/agent hcls
```

Or load individual skills on the fly:
```
/context add ./hcls-agent-skills/skills/variant-calling/SKILL.md
```

#### Multi-Agent Mode (Kiro)

For context-efficient specialist routing (loads ~15K tokens per specialist instead of ~80K for all 38 skills):

```bash
./install.sh --target kiro --mode multiagent

# Switch to the coordinator:
/agent hcls-multiagent
```

The coordinator routes queries to 8 domain specialists:

| Specialist | Domain |
|-----------|--------|
| hcls-genomics | Variant classification, NGS pipelines, RNA-seq |
| hcls-omics | Single-cell, proteomics, multi-omics, biomarkers |
| hcls-imaging | DICOM, digital pathology, radiology preprocessing |
| hcls-drug-discovery | Docking, cheminformatics, drug repurposing, translational |
| hcls-clinical-data | HL7/FHIR, CDISC/SDTM, EDC validation |
| hcls-rwe | Pharmacoepidemiology, RWD cohorts, risk indices |
| hcls-healthcare-ops | Claims billing, risk adjustment, prior auth, HEDIS |
| hcls-ai-infra | ML experiment design, AWS architecture |


### Amazon Quick

Amazon Quick loads skills via GUI upload of individual `SKILL.md` files:

```bash
# See which skills to upload and instructions
./install.sh --target quick-desktop
```

Upload path: **Settings → Capabilities → Skills → Upload** → select a `SKILL.md` file. Start with one domain and add more as needed. Follow the instructions in [Skills and agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quick/latest/userguide/skills-and-agents-desktop.html) in the Amazon Quick documentation.

### AWS Strands Agents SDK

For the AWS Strands Agents SDK, load skills directly in your Python code:

```bash
pip install strands-agents
```

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentSkills
from strands.models.bedrock import BedrockModel

model = BedrockModel(model_id="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514", region_name="us-east-1")
skills = AgentSkills(skills="./hcls-agent-skills/skills/")
agent = Agent(model=model, plugins=[skills])
```

Skills integrate natively with [Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/) — no wrappers or adapters needed. The `AgentSkills` plugin discovers and loads all skills from the specified directory. Skills activate automatically based on query content.

### Amazon AgentCore

Once your skill-equipped agent works locally, you can move it to production. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides an alternative path to inject skills into hosted agents. In addition to embedding them in the Strands agent code, you can configure skills at the environment level so they're available to any agent running in that harness.

Alternatively you can load skills to AgentCore harness, by following [Skills](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-skills.html) in the AgentCore documentation. AgentCore harness provides managed hosting, Auto Scaling, security boundaries, and observability capabilities without managing infrastructure.

### Claude Code

```bash
# Install into your project (symlinks to repo, so updates propagate)
npx skills add awslabs/hcls-agent-skills -a claude-code
```

Skills auto-activate when Claude Code detects relevant topics in your prompts. No agent config needed — Claude Code discovers skills from `.claude/skills/` automatically.

## Quick Start

Invoke a skill by describing the task in natural language — your agent will match on the skill's triggers:

```
> I have a new candidate biomarker for early-stage NSCLC. Help me design a validation study.
[agent loads translational-research skill]
```

Or request a pipeline skill explicitly:

```
> Use the digital-pathology skill to tile this SVS file at 20x with 512px tiles.
```

## Evaluation

An automated evaluation suite measures whether skills improve agent responses. See [`eval/README.md`](./eval/README.md) for full documentation.

**Quick run:**
```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 && uv pip install -e .
python -m eval.run --parallel 2 --version v4 --pairwise
python eval/build_review.py
open eval/results/review.html
```

**Latest results (pairwise, 410 prompts — 38 skills + 3 cross-skill categories):** Overall win rate **70–86%** (v9 Strands: 85.9%, d=0.97; v3 kiro-cli: 69.5%, d=0.39), critical thinking **77–85%**. Eval reports show results across 8 versions testing different harness configurations. See [`eval/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`](./eval/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md) and [`eval/HARNESS_EFFECTS.md`](./eval/HARNESS_EFFECTS.md) for the full analysis.
